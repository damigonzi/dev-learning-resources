Front End Notes:
1. HTML is the structure of the web page
  a. Head contains meta data
  b. Good meta data allows for search engines to better find your web page (SEO)
2. HTML Semantics are important for proper web page layouts/structure
  a. Good semantics allow for better accessibility tools to work with your web page
  b. Good semantics allows for some search engines / tools to better read your web page
3. HTML Forms can receive user input and redirect users to a new webpage or allow users to submit data via a Rest API
4. Open Graph Protocol is so other websites can easily embed valueable info from your web page ("Social media card")
5. HTML allows you to embed videos/audio/images
6. The web browsers like Chrome are built in with buttons, video players, calendar date selectors, etc.
7. HTML5 Canvas allows you to render 2D/3D motion graphics via Javascript on the webpage
8. Some people will take advantage of your web page vulnerabilities. It is important to add best practices to avoid attacks.
  a. Server side validation is better than client side validation, since users can manipulate the HTML/Javascript in their web browser
  b. HTTPS PUT is less secure than HTTPS GET, because with PUT the meta data is contained in the URL itself. This is then stored in the users browsers
     history until they delete it. If a credit card number was sent via HTTPS PUT, then the valuable information may be held in the web browser cache/history
     for some time. With HTTPS Get, the meta data is sent via the body of the JSON, thereofore, not stored in the browser memory.
  c. iFrames are not secure and best if not used.
9. CSS Psuedo-elements allow you to style a specific part of an element, like the first word, selected text, hover, etc.
